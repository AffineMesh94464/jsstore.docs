# Contributing

There are multiple folders and source code in this repo, but you dont need to worry about that. As this is a document project for jsstore - you are allowed to change only docs folder in the root.

# Docs Folder

There are three folders inside docs - 

* example - contains the examples
* tutorial - contains the tutorial
* v1 - contains the docs for v1. 

Every file is a markdown file.   

# How to

* Open a file - let's say "tutorial/insert.md".
* Change the content and preview it. You can download an extension in your code editor. Previewing is very necessary to make sure whatever you have changed looks good.
* You can even run the project, by runing the following command - 
    * cd src
    * npm run dev
    * If you changed the doc again, then run cmd - node build.js : it converts the md to html causing the dev server to refresh. 
* Send the PR.
